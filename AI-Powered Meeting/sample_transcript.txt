Meeting Transcript - Product Launch Planning
Date: 2024-01-15
Participants: Alice (PM), Bob (Dev), Carol (Marketing)

Alice: Let's discuss the Q2 product launch timeline. We need to finalize the feature set by March 1st.

Bob: I can commit to having the core functionality ready by February 28th. However, we have a risk with the payment integration - the third-party API might not be stable.

Carol: From marketing perspective, we've decided to focus on the mobile-first approach for our campaign. Alice, can you confirm the budget allocation?

Alice: Yes, we've decided to allocate $50K for digital marketing. Bob, please coordinate with the QA team for testing by March 15th.

Bob: Will do. I'll also need Carol to provide the marketing copy for the in-app notifications by March 10th.

Carol: Noted. I'll have that ready. One concern - if we delay the launch, we might miss the seasonal opportunity.

Alice: Good point. Let's make the March 30th launch date non-negotiable. Any other risks we should consider?

Bob: Database scalability could be an issue if we get more than 10K users in the first week.

Alice: Decision made - we'll implement auto-scaling from day one. Meeting adjourned.
